Project Review Summary and Plan

Summary of Current State:
- HTML pages have consistent structure and styling but some inconsistencies in CSS linking (relative vs absolute paths).
- Product images are placeholders and repeated across products.
- Cart page lacks dynamic cart item listing and checkout functionality.
- Add to Cart buttons update cart count only, no cart item management.
- Products page has filtering UI and JavaScript filtering but no backend or persistent data.
- Contact and login forms have validation but no backend or submission handling.
- JavaScript provides basic interactivity but no real data persistence or user authentication.
- CSS files are mostly complete and consistent with a modern responsive design.

Planned Improvements:
1. Fix CSS linking inconsistencies across HTML pages for uniformity.
2. Suggest replacing placeholder product images with distinct images or indicate need for real images.
3. Implement dynamic cart item management and display on cart page (using localStorage).
4. Enhance Add to Cart buttons to add specific products to cart with quantity management.
5. Implement checkout button functionality or link to a checkout page (if applicable).
6. Improve search and filter UI if needed.
7. Add basic form handling or indicate future backend integration for contact and login forms.
8. Test all pages for responsiveness and interactivity.
9. Fix any accessibility or usability issues found.

Next Steps:
- Proceed with implementing the above improvements step-by-step.
- Provide updates after each major change for review.
